    <h2>About Project in_sight</h2>

    <p>Project in_sight is focused on the presence of people in sense of occupation and exploitation of available space.</p>
    <p>and to extimate the number of devices at a location at a certain time, representing presence of people at that place at that time or for a certain duration.</p>
    <p>The main client for this project is the TU Delft Facility Management & Real Estate (FMRE). </p>
    <p>Their aim is to improve the conducting of resources and efforts by improving their understanding of the use of the TU Delft campus. </p>
    <p>FMRE expects an estimation of the efficiency of the spaces covered  in their real estate portfolio in order to be used for predictive occupation. </p>
    <br/>

    <p>The project was started as a Synthesis Project for the MSc Geomatics for the Built Environment program.</p>
    <p>The general scope of the project is the monitoring of flows and occupation patterns with wifi.</p>
    <br/>

    <h4>Research Question</h4>
    <h3>To what extent can the alignment of occupation and exploitation of educational facilities</h3>
    <h3>on different scales be indicated through WiFi monitoring?</h3>
